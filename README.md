#  What This Project Does

The Nairobi real estate market is complex, fragmented, and often opaque. This system cuts through the noise by learning from actual property listings and delivering data-driven price estimates.

At a Glance

- Scrapes real property listings from the web

- Cleans and standardizes messy market data

- Trains ML models to learn pricing patterns

- Visualizes market trends and price drivers

- Serves predictions through an interactive web app

# Key Achievements

### Model Details:

- Model: Random Forest Regressor

- Features: 24

- Training samples: 213

- Test samples: 54

### Performance Metrics:

- MAE: ±7.04M KES → ~18% improvement over baseline

- R²: 0.703 → Explains 70.3% of price variance

# Problem Statement

Property pricing in Nairobi often relies on:

- Guesswork

- Inconsistent agent advice

- Limited market transparency

This leads to overpriced listings, missed opportunities, and poor investment decisions.

### price prediction 
![](https://github.com/MastingoJay/NAIROBI-LISTINGS-ANALYSIS/blob/main/pictures/pricing%20app%20service%20page.png)

### Core Features
* **Modern UI/UX:** Clean, responsive design with a gradient-styled interface and intuitive property configuration controls.
* **Instant Valuations:** Real-time price predictions that update dynamically as user inputs change.
* **Smart Ranges:** Provides a "Price Ceiling" and "Floor Price" based on the model's Mean Absolute Error (MAE), offering a realistic confidence interval.
* **Market Intelligence:** Embedded dashboard showing the top 5 most expensive locations and bedroom-to-value growth trends.
* **Interactive Visuals:** Dynamic charts powered by **Plotly** for a deeper understanding of market segments.
* **Price Efficiency:** Automatic calculation of price-per-square-foot to help users identify undervalued deals.

### How to Launch
1. Ensure you have the dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application from the root directory:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/pricing_app.py

# Data Pipeline

## 1. Data Collection
- Source: Property24.co.ke
- Method: Custom BeautifulSoup web scraper.
- Features: Location, type, bedrooms, bathrooms, size, amenities, price.

## 2. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate listings and standardized location names.
- Filtered size outliers (<200 sqft or >20,000 sqft).
- Filtered price outliers (<5M KES or >100M KES).

## 3. Feature Engineering

Created Features:

- price_per_sqft - Price normalized by size for comparison

- amenity_score - Count of amenities (0-5)

- month - Temporal features from listing dates


## 4. Model Training

**Models Developed:**

| Model               | MAE (M KES) | R² Score | Notes |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Linear Regression  | 8.04        | 0.623    | Baseline, works best for mid-range properties |
| Random Forest      | 7.04        | 0.703    | Winner! Better handling of non-linear relationships and amenities impact |

**Winner:** Random Forest Regressor 

**Improvements Over Baseline:**  
- **MAE:** 12.6% better (8.04M → 7.04M KES)  
- **R²:** 12.9% improvement (0.623 → 0.703)  
- Handles non-linear relationships and complex feature interactions more effectively.
